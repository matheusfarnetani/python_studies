## Abouts

### [Guess Game](https://github.com/matheusfarnetani/studies/blob/main/python_guess_game/guess_game.py)<br>
Develop a guess the number game, where the computer chooses a random integer from 0 to 10, and the user has 5 attempts to guess the number.
*  Implement a scoring system with the following behavior: if the user guesses the number on the first try, he will receive the maximum score (eg 100 points); if the user guesses the number in the last attempt, he will receive the minimum score (eg 10 points); if the user doesn't get the number right, he won't get any points.
* Implement error control. If the player enters a number outside the allowed range or non-numeric characters, the system must notify the player and request the correct entry.
* Implement the option for the user to start a new game. At the end of a round, after the final result, the game must ask if the player wants to start a new game and, if not, close the application.
